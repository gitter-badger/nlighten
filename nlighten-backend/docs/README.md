# Documentation for Nlighten

## recommendation for documentation process

Every important part of the solution should be documented in a simple form of Markdown files in this folder.  
For example `server-configuration.md` with brief info about widlfly setup, `security.md` for details about security handling.

If possible, keep the docs short and up-to-date.
